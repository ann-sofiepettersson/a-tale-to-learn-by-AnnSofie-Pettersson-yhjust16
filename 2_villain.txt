Suddenly one of the shops clerks, bony and old mrs Moneypenny, steps in the girls way. "Where do you think you are going?" Mrs Moneypenny asks.
"I don't want any window shoppers at my store, if you want to come in here you will need money and lots of it" Mrs Moneypenny is
laughing condescendingly towards the girl. "AND there is no return policy!".
The girl was surprised, 'how did she know that i have no money to buy something? Perhaps there is something with the way i look, with all these old clothes...'
